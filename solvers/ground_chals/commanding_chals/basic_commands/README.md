# Basic Commands

This script points a specified groundstation to a constant azimuth and elevation, and also sets the radio settings for that groundstation. This is a skeleton that can be used for more advanced pointing.

The script: 
 - First: Selects the current groundstation and set it to a point at a specific azimuth and elevation
 - Second: Sets the groundstations radio settings to match the radio settings of the satellite we'd like to communciate with
 - Third: Enables telemetry on the satellite
