# Radio Configuration

Teams have the ability to change the settings of the radios on both their ground stations and their satellites. In this game changing the radio settings will not have an effect on the performance of your radio. However radios with the same settings are able to talk to each other so changing your radio configuration allows you to keep other teams from sending you rogue commands. Furthermore completing the yay science challenge requires players to meet the same settings as the science station.
