# PID Control

This challenge is a simple parameter update challenge.

The default control settings for the ADCS do not have a good set of parameters for the PID controllers that generate reaction wheel commands.

The result of this is that the satellite doesnt smoothly control itself. This means that it takes longer to achieve pointing commands and while pointing the angular velocity may get excessivly high which can cost SLA points.
