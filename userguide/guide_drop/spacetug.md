# Spacetug

Spacetugs are a method of recovering a satellite with a penalty. It should be used by operators when a satellite is unrecoverable.

Spacetugs will be available at any time to teams that request it. However, spacetugs will be required in specific scenarios:

 - Battery reaches zero
 - Satellite is unrecoverable due to user error

In the case that the satellite is unrecoverable due to an *unintentional* bug, a spacetug will be provided with no penalty.

During a spacetug the following will happen to bring your satellite into a recoverable state.
 - Despining of reaction wheels
 - Despining of the spacecraft
 - Charging of the battery
 - Modifying TX/RX Spaceradio settings to make communication possible

These actions will occur in real-time.

## Spacetug Penalty

There will be a delay of {XX} minutes before the spacetug begins after a request is made.

The full spacetug will stay attached until your satellite is recovered according to the parameters above.
